The train and test CSV files are from kaggle.

I used pandas and sklearn linear_model "LogisticRegression" libraries in cleaning, formating, and creating a model to predict data.

both test and train files were formatted and the train file was fed to the model.

The model was used on the test file and it lead to reasonable outcomes.
